# README
I am a motivated and detail-oriented professional with a background in healthcare, now transitioning into the field of data science and analytics. Currently enrolled in the Master's of Data Analytics program at the Robinson College of Business, I'm excited to leverage my strong analytical skills and problem-solving mindset to explore data-driven insights and contribute to solving complex challenges.

With several years of experience in the healthcare industry, I've built a solid foundation in critical thinking, organization, and client-facing roles. Now, I'm shifting my focus to using data to inform decision-making and drive impactful insights.

I'm particularly excited about diving into predictive modeling, machine learning, and data visualization, and I'm dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge in these areas. I look forward to building connections with professionals and students who share a passion for using data to create meaningful solutions.
